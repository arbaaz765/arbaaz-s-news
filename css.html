      <p><h2>Bhatia said the leaders would have been “watching wrong content” that led to possible malware infestation on their devices.

“We too have spoken to cyber experts. There are a few countries that have enmity against India and are experts in spying of this kind. I would like to say that malware, phishing and spyware come on your phone when an individual accesses such websites and even watch wrong content," the BJP leader said.

The BJP leader also questioned the opposition leaders for not seeking legal redressal over their complaints.</strong></a>

"Apple has made it clear that these alerts are often false alarms. It should be asked why Rahul Gandhi and others don't follow the legal process, don't file a police complaint or write to Apple company but do politics.

Targeting Rahul Gandhi, Gaurav Bhatia said, “Rahul Gandhi, I would like to request you to make good use of your mobile phone. Don't forge an alliance with any such anti-national force or don't access any such website which is inappropriate for any Indian."

Earlier today, opposition leaders from different political parties accused the government of snooping on them. They shared screenshots of a message received on their Apple devices which said that "state-sponsored attackers" may be targeting their iPhones.

The leaders included Shashi Tharoor, Raghav Chadha, Priyanka Chaturvedi, Asaduddin Owaisi and others.

Meanwhile, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi targeted the Modi government over the "Apple warning message" and said it was trying to divert the attention of people from real issues.

In response to the opposition leaders' allegations, Union IT Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw on Tuesday said that the people who cannot see the growth of the country are indulging in destructive politics, ANI reported.

The minister said that such advisories have been sent to people in 150 countries.
